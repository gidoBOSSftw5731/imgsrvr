How To:

1. If you have a issue, make a issue.
2. Write a detailed explaination on what the issue is, what you did, and what this will affect.
3. If you are to attempt to make a "dumb"* commit just to jet a contributor badge, you will be either warned or banned.

*Note, any terms like this depend on the contributor flagging and may vary.
